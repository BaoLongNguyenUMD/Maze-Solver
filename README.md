# Maze-Solver
This is my CMSC132 Maze Solver Project.
Unfortunately, due to the University of Maryland's policy on sharing code online, I am not allowed to directly post my code content onto Github. 
However, still please watch the demo in the repository.
Thank you! 

This project tested my knowledge and implementation of graphs and path finding algorithms. 
After generating a random maze, the program converts it into a graph and then begins to find the solution with the path finding algorithm the user specifies.
